### May 

- [**Recognizing Spatial Intelligence**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/recognizing-spatial-intel/): Spatial cognitive abilities seem to be the best proxy for raw, general intelligence. While verbal and quantitative abilities, as tested by the SAT, can be gamified and memorized, the capacity to generate, rotate, and transform visual images (especially in higher dimensions) cannot be easily taugh. This distinction is evident in how people learn and understand calculus: memorizing steps to take a derivative is very different from visualizing vector geometries and rederiving the concept of a derivative from scratch. anyway, much of our education system and many jobs focus on definitions and jargon. Memorization instead of actual understanding and the ability to rederive concepts from first principles

### June 

- [Your Thoughts Can Release Abilities Beyond Normal Limits](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-thoughts-can-release-abilities-beyond-normal-limits/): Basically, the placebo effect is real and can be used to improve performance in a variety of tasks. This is article shows how our thoughts are often capable of extending our cognitive and physical limits.
