# The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry 

The book is divided into two parts: the first addresses the issue of hurry in our daily lives, while the second suggests that instead of trying to get more time, we should manage our time better. The author advocates for living a life similar to that of Jesus, emphasizing the importance of moments of silence and solitude with God. He shares how these habits transformed his life and provides practical tips for incorporating them into daily routines.

## Words and snippets that made me feel/think


"Corrie ten Boom once said that if the devil can't make you sin, he'll make you busy. 

There's truth in that. Both sin and busyness have the exact same effect-they cut off your connection to God, to other people, and even to your own soul.
The famous psychologist Carl Jung had this little saying:

Hurry is not of the devil; hurry is the devil."


"There's a reason people talk about "walking" with God, not "running" with God. It's because God is love."


"Meaning, very little can be done with hurry that can't be done better without it. Especially our lives with God. And even our work for God."

"
I mean, how do we have any kind of spiritual life at all if we can't pay attention longer than a goldfish? How do you pray, read the Scriptures, sit under a teaching at church, or rest well on the Sabbath when every chance you get, you reach for the dopamine dispenser that is your phone?

"It's been proven by study after study: there is zero correlation between hurry and productivity. In fact, once you work a certain number of hours in a week, your productivity plummets. Wanna know what the number is? Fifty hours. Ironic: that's about a six-day workweek. One study found that there was zero difference in productivity between workers who logged seventy hours and those who logged fifty-five.*"




"Dan Allender, in his book Sabbath, had this to say:

The Sabbath is an invitation to enter delight. The Sabbath, when experienced as God intended, is the best day of our lives. Without question or thought, it is the best day of the week. It is the day we anticipate on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—and the day we remember on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. Sabbath is the holy time where we feast, play, dance, have sex, sing, pray, laugh, tell stories, read, paint, walk, and watch creation in its fullness. Few people are willing to enter the Sabbath and sanctify it, to make it holy, because a full day of delight and joy is more than most people can bear in a lifetime, let alone a week.«
"



"[...] cited the happiest people on earth. Near the top of the list was a group of Christians called Seventh-day Adventists, who are religious, literally, about the Sabbath. This doctor noted that they lived ten years longer than the average American."



"
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. ... In almost every act of our daily lives ... we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons ….. who pull the wires which control the public
mind.s"




"The goal here is to live with a high degree of intentionality around what matters most, which, for those of us who apprentice under Jesus, is Jesus himself and his kingdom."




"Set a time and a time limit for social media (or just get off it).
