## A Book I Almost Didn’t Read: We by Yevgeny Zamyatin

My boyfriend gave me We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, knowing I have a thing for dystopian stories. Still, I let the book sit on my desk for months before opening it. Maybe it was the weight of the genre, or the fear it wouldn’t live up to the others I love. But once I finally started reading it, I was pulled in much faster than I expected.

We is set in a hyper-rational future where people live in glass buildings, wear identical clothing, and have their lives scheduled down to the minute. Emotions are considered a disease, and even imagination is a threat to the perfect balance of the State. Everyone is known by a number, not a name (the protagonist is D-503, a mathematician and builder of a spacecraft called the Integral, designed to export their “perfect” society to other planets.)

Right away, I saw echoes of other dystopias I’ve read, Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451. But what struck me most about We was how early it was written, and yet how timeless it feels. I could sense how deeply it influenced those later books. And while I’m kind of biased  (I love stories about totalitarian regimes and their slow collapse) We felt different. Its language is stranger, more chaotic, more poetic. It's written like a series of journal entries, and D-503's mind slowly unravels in real time as he falls for the mysterious rebel I-330.

One small detail haunted me long after I closed the book: D-503's obsession with numbers and how he believes the universe is ruled by absolute logic. At one point, I started thinking about how humans can’t create truly random numbers. Even when we try, our minds fall into patterns. It’s like there's a tiny tyrant inside us, always trying to bring order to chaos. That made the world of We feel even more real, this desperate need to quantify everything, to believe that randomness and freedom are mistakes that can be corrected.

But the most powerful image for me comes near the end: the scene with the grass growing where it shouldn't be. They’re trying to launch the Integral (a symbol of control, reason, and conquest) and there's grass breaking through. Something alive growing in the cracks of this perfectly ordered world. No matter how advanced the system, no matter how polished the glass or how precise the equations, the grass will come back.

In the end, D-503 is forced to undergo an “operation” to remove his imagination. The rebellion fails (at least on the surface) and the State reasserts control. But that little image of the grass lingers. It reminds us that even under total control, something soft and stubborn still pushes upward. That maybe freedom is not an idea we build, but a force that grows on its own.

Reading We was both unsettling and familiar. I waited too long to read it, but I’m glad I finally did.
